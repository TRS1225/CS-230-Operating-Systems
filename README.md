# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room client is a company which commissioned my company, Creative Technology Solutions, whom I work for as a Technology Consultant, to develop a web-based game which serves multiple  platforms and is based on their current (Android only) game, 'Draw It or Lose It'.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

In my opinion, I think what I did well was outline the technical how-to and specifications by which their web-based game could be distributed among multiple platforms. Everything from client requirements, design contraints, to a final recommendation.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The design document provides a blueprint and a plan for the code in terms of not only which language but which operating platform the game should be distributed on. Similar to a pseudocode document but much more in-depth.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I did rush through the description of the UML diagram, and I could have taken my time on that part of the document more thoroughly. I could improve it by learning more about different Object Oriented Principals and applying those in an abstract way to summarize the depiction of UML diagrams.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

By reading the guidelines and rubric of the assignments very carefully word by word, and making decisions as to which technical approach would best suit the client's requirements and constraints. By understanding the needs of the client and what their intended purpose for the software is, I can determine what is also best for the end user -- in this case, players of the game. In this case, it is important to consider the user's needs because the end user is the target market.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

First, from a programming and development standpoint, it's important to know what you're doing. Therefore, research and knowledge are paramount before code is typed. So the bottom line is regardless of which particular task the code is intended to do, it's most important to know what problem you're trying to solve and what the end result should be. That was my approach in this course's assignments.
